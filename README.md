Hello techie! I am excited to share that I have started solving problems on Hackerearth, and although I faced some initial difficulties, I saw that no one had uploaded content or solutions for the problems I was facing.
So, I took the initiative to create a repository that could be useful for others facing similar challenges. You can find it here. 
I am committed to solving more problems and sharing the solutions on Github for the benefit of the community.
